§ 1. 	Derivative laws, when not casual, are almost always contingent on collocations 	78
2. 	On what grounds they can be extended to cases beyond the bounds of actual experience 	80

[Pg vii]
Chapter XXI. Of the Evidence of the Law of Universal Causation.
§ 1. 	The law of causality does not rest on an instinct 	95
2. 	But on an induction by simple enumeration 	100

§ 1. 	Second requisite of philosophical language, a name for every important meaning 	248
2. 	—viz. first, an accurate descriptive terminology 	248

5. 	How the names of Kinds should be constructed 	280

Chapter VIII. Of Classification by Series.
§ 1. 	Natural groups should be arranged in a natural series 	284
2. 	The arrangement should follow the degrees of the main phenomenon 	285
3. 	—which implies the assumption of a type-species 	287
